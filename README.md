# Hospital-Management-System
Hospital Management System using Java and MySQL. It automates administrative tasks like patient and doctor management, appointment booking, and record-keeping. I designed it with object-oriented principles for scalability and efficiency. This project improved my Java skills and understanding of healthcare systems.
